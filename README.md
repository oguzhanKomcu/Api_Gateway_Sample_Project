# Api_Gateway_Sample_Project
In this project, in an application that uses the microservice approach, I made a sample project on the use of the Ocelot library from the "Api Gateway" configurations, which undertakes to direct the incoming requests to the relevant services.

In the continuation of my project, I first pushed it to github. Then I turned it into a docker container with the help of Jenkins running in my docker. In this way, I made arrangements for running the codes I developed on .Net along with a pipeline that started with push to github.
